# Container Component chart

Reconciles one Container Component environment in a single Argo CD Application.

The chart always creates the environment-local ImageStream. An optional release value file supplies
`image.tag`; until a tag is selected, Deployment, Service, Route, and promotion resources remain
absent. There is no separate Component infrastructure Application.

## Rendered capabilities

| Condition | Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Every active Component environment | ImageStream |
| `image.tag` is set | Deployment, Service, optional Route, and runtime configuration |
| `build.enabled: true` and `environment == build.environment` | Pipeline, Triggers, webhook Route, and initial-build hook |
| Non-build environment with a human `image.tag` | Deterministic release-specific promotion launcher Job |

The build-environment release may select `latest`. Promoted environments require an immutable
human tag such as `v1.2.3`.

## Build and human release paths

Main pushes and release tags invoke one Component Pipeline:

| Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Main push | Run the approved profile recipe, publish `git-<full-commit-sha>`, update `latest`, and optionally restart the runtime |
| Human tag | Resolve the tagged commit, find its existing commit image, and create the human tag on the same digest |

The release path accepts `v<major>[.<minor>[.<patch>]][-<prerelease>]`. It never packages source,
rebuilds an image, updates `latest`, or restarts the runtime. The shared tag guard permits an absent
tag or a tag already resolving to the same digest and rejects reassignment to a different digest.

The Pipeline resolves Operator-managed `git-clone` and `buildah` Tasks from
`openshift-pipelines`; generic platform Tasks such as `maven`, `nodejs`, and the tag guard live in
`tekton-tasks`. Charts own orchestration and approved recipes but render no `Task` or inline
`taskSpec`. Source repositories are public and cloned without a Git credential.

## Approved build profiles

Tenant state selects only `build.profile`; it cannot choose builder images, commands, Dockerfiles,
or health defaults.

| Profile | Package execution | Image input | Runtime defaults |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quarkus-jvm` | Maven `clean verify -B`, Java 21 | `Dockerfile.jvm` | HTTP 8080, Quarkus health on 9000 |
| `quarkus-native` | Maven wrapper `clean verify -Dnative -DskipITs -B`, Mandrel JDK 21 | `Dockerfile.native` | HTTP 8080, Quarkus health on 9000 |
| `spring-boot` | Maven `clean verify -B`, Java 21 | `Dockerfile` | HTTP 8080, actuator health on 8081 |
| `nodejs` | `npm ci` and test on Node 24 (the scaffold test builds first) | `Dockerfile` | HTTP/health on 8080 |

The generic Maven Task prefers an executable repository `./mvnw` and otherwise uses the image's
`/usr/bin/mvn`. This is required for the approved Mandrel image, which contains Java/native-image
but not a system Maven binary.

## Initial build

The initial-build Job is an Argo CD Sync hook:

| Sync wave | Resources |
| ---: | --- |
| 1 | Pipeline and Trigger resources |
| 2 | Initial-build hook Job |
| 3 | Runtime Deployment |

The Job follows the PipelineRun with `tkn` and fails the sync when the build fails. Successful Jobs
are retained so ordinary syncs do not rebuild unchanged source. Failed Jobs are removed to allow a
later sync retry.

## Promotion launcher

A non-build release renders a regular GitOps-managed launcher Job. Its deterministic name includes
the Component, target environment, and human release version. The launcher:

1. waits for the target-local `promote-image` Pipeline with a bounded retry;
2. starts a PipelineRun with the Component and human release tag;
3. confirms submission succeeded;
4. exits without following the promotion logs.

Before starting the PipelineRun, an init container checks the exact target Tekton `Pipeline` with
the existing `get` permission. It retries for five minutes to tolerate Argo/ApplicationSet
propagation and surfaces the final API error on timeout. It does not list PipelineRuns.

Deployment and promotion converge independently, so temporary `ImagePullBackOff` is expected while
the image is copied.

See [Operations](../../../docs/operations.md#promotion-launcher-failures) for safe retry procedures.

## Runtime configuration

| Values | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `runtime.resources` | Container requests and limits |
| `runtime.env` | Explicit environment variables |
| `runtime.envFromSecretNames` | Secret-backed `envFrom`; omitted when empty |
| `runtime.imagePullSecretNames` | Pod-level pull Secrets; omitted when empty |
| `runtime.health` | Readiness and liveness paths, port, delays, and periods |
| `route.enabled` | OpenShift Route creation |

Runtime Secrets, including Quay pull credentials, must be created and synchronized outside this
chart.

## Security notes

- Release materialization mounts the configured registry push Secret read-only for the duration of
  its Task.
- The chart creates neither Quay credentials nor the `QuayIntegration`.
- Webhook signature verification is reserved but not implemented; exposed EventListeners are
  lab/development-only.

## Validate

```bash
helm lint charts/component/container
helm template example-component charts/component/container -f /path/to/component-values.yaml
