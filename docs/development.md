# Development and testing

[Back to the repository overview](../README.md)

Use this guide when changing chart templates, schemas, platform contracts, or test fixtures.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Helm on `PATH` (repository CI is pinned to `v3.17.3`)
- A sibling `software-templates` checkout only for the optional producer/consumer compatibility
  test

No live cluster is required for the default suite.

## Run the chart suite

```bash
helm version --short
make test
```

All Node and Jest tooling is scoped under `test/`; this repository itself is not an npm package.
The direct equivalent is `npm ci --prefix test` followed by `npm test --prefix test`.

The Jest test runner:

- lints all charts;
- renders representative build and non-build environments;
- parses multi-document YAML;
- validates discovery, lifecycle, project ownership, RBAC, build, publication, and promotion
  contracts;
- exercises split platform/tenant SCM;
- uses nonstandard environment names to catch hard-coded lifecycle assumptions.

Release-policy tests are intentionally excluded from this fast suite. `make release-check` runs
the fast suite, the focused release tests, and release-candidate validation.

## Focused Helm feedback

Lint an individual chart:

```bash
helm lint charts/domain/environment
helm lint charts/system/environment
helm lint charts/component/container
helm lint charts/api/openapi
helm lint charts/resource/postgresql
```

Render with explicit values:

```bash
helm template tenant-domain charts/domain/environment \
  -f /path/to/merged-target-and-domain-entities.yaml
```

Keep example values valid against each chart's `values.schema.json`.

## Cross-repository compatibility

The software templates produce the values and discovery files consumed by these charts. From the
sibling repository, run:

```bash
cd ../software-templates
npm ci --prefix test
DEVELOPER_CHARTS_DIR=../developer-charts \
PLATFORM_COMPONENTS_DIR=../platform-components \
npm run --prefix test test:compatibility
```

The three sibling repositories form a contributor integration workspace. Workshop installers
normally fork only `platform-components` and consume released chart dependencies, so they do not
need to clone this workspace or run coordinated current-source tests.

Run this whenever changing a values key, discovery path, Domain entrypoint, or leaf chart input.

## Change checklist

- Update `values.schema.json` when the public values contract changes.
- Add or update a rendered contract assertion.
- Preserve split tenant/platform SCM behavior.
- Test both build and non-build environments when lifecycle logic changes.
- Test an adjacent promotion and reject mutable or non-adjacent release inputs.
- Verify only build-environment renders create derived AppProjects.
- Run `make test`.
- Run the template compatibility suite when producer inputs change.
- Update the chart README and architecture guide for operating or ownership changes.
