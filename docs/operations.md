# Operations and troubleshooting

[Back to the repository overview](../README.md)

This guide focuses on expected convergence behavior and safe retry procedures.

## Start with ownership

Before retrying anything, identify the controller that owns the failed object:

| Object or state | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Parent Domain Application | Platform tenant admission |
| Domain and System AppProjects | Parent Domain or build-environment System Application |
| ApplicationSets and leaf Applications | Domain or System chart |
| Initial API publication Job | OpenAPI chart |
| Initial Component build Job | Container Component chart |
| Promotion launcher Job | Container Component chart |
| Promotion Pipeline and RBAC | System chart |
| ImageStream, Deployment, Service, and Route | Container Component chart |

Prefer changing Git or retrying a documented Job/Pipeline over editing a rendered object in place.

## Initial API publication

The initial-publish Job is an Argo CD Sync hook. It waits for the API PipelineRun and makes sync
failure visible when validation or publication fails.

Check:

1. the API repository revision and public clone access;
2. `specification.yaml` syntax and required OpenAPI fields;
3. the `git-clone` and Java 21 `maven` Task resolution;
4. the Schema Registry URL and network reachability;
5. the PipelineRun and Maven logs.

A successful named hook Job is retained to prevent ordinary syncs from republishing the same
revision. A failed hook is removed through `HookFailed`, so a later Argo CD sync can retry it after
the underlying problem is fixed.

## Initial Component build

The initial-build Job follows the PipelineRun with
`tkn --showlog --exit-with-pipelinerun-error`. If the Pipeline fails, the Argo CD sync fails.

Check:

1. anonymous clone access to the Component repository;
2. Maven dependency and Schema Registry access;
3. build ServiceAccount and SCC permissions;
4. Quay push credentials and repository provisioning;
5. Dockerfile path and implementation profile.

As with API publication, a successful Job is retained and a failed hook is retryable on a later
sync.

## Component release materialization

A human Git tag such as `v1.7.3` does not rebuild source. The Pipeline resolves the peeled commit,
then attempts to copy the existing `git-<sha>` image to `v1.7.3`.

If it fails:

- confirm the tag matches the accepted release grammar;
- verify the corresponding main commit image exists;
- inspect access to the build repository's push credential;
- check whether the human tag already exists and which digest it references.

The materialization path does not wait for a missing commit image. Before copying, its shared digest
guard permits an absent release tag or an existing tag at the same digest and rejects an existing
tag at a different digest. Retry only after confirming the commit image exists; do not move the Git
tag or attempt to reassign the human image version.

## Promotion launcher failures

Each non-build release has a deterministic launcher Job name based on Component, target
environment, and release. If launcher creation itself fails, delete only that release-specific Job
and let Argo CD recreate it:

```bash
oc delete job <launcher-job> -n <target-namespace>
```

Use this only after fixing the root cause, such as missing Pipeline readiness or local RBAC.

The launcher waits up to five minutes for the exact target `Pipeline` before invoking
`tkn pipeline start`. The readiness check uses only `get` on Pipelines; it does not require listing
PipelineRuns. On timeout, inspect the final `oc get pipeline.tekton.dev` error emitted by the init
container before retrying the Argo sync.

## Promotion Pipeline failures

The launcher exits after successfully creating a PipelineRun; it does not follow promotion logs.
If Tekton later fails, rerun the target-local `promote-image` Pipeline with the same Component and
human release tag.

This retry is idempotent:

- an existing matching destination digest succeeds;
- a different destination digest fails;
- External Secrets keeps a narrowly scoped copy of the source pull credential in the target
  namespace;
- the target `pipeline` ServiceAccount supplies that pull credential and the target push credential
  through standard Tekton registry authentication.

## Temporary ImagePullBackOff

The target Deployment and promotion PipelineRun reconcile independently. The Deployment can appear
before the image copy finishes, producing a temporary `ImagePullBackOff`. This is expected when:

- the launcher submitted the PipelineRun successfully;
- the PipelineRun is still active or about to start;
- Kubernetes continues retrying pulls.

Investigate when the PipelineRun has failed, no PipelineRun was created, or the error remains after
the destination tag and digest are available.

## AppProject conflicts

Only build-environment Applications should create derived projects:

| Project | Expected creator |
| --- | --- |
| `tenant-<domain>` | Domain build-environment Application |
| `tenant-<domain>-<system>` | System build-environment Application |

If several Applications claim the same AppProject, confirm the Domain lifecycle's build
designation and verify non-build renders do not include the project template.

## Escalation information

Capture the following before escalating:

- Domain, System, Component or API, and environment names;
- Argo CD Application health and sync status;
- failed Job and PipelineRun names;
- relevant controller or Task logs;
- selected Git revision or human release tag;
- source and target image digests, when promotion is involved;
- whether the expected Quay credential Secrets exist, without copying their contents.
