# Architecture

[Back to the repository overview](../README.md)

The developer charts translate reviewed tenant Git state into OpenShift resources. The design keeps
tenant intent, platform policy, and runtime reconciliation separate.

## Centralized implementation policy

The charts are a policy layer, not just a collection of reusable YAML. They answer questions
that tenant intent should not answer independently: which Task implementations are trusted, where
images live, how credentials move between namespaces, which operators implement Resources, and
how Argo CD ownership is divided.

Centralizing those answers gives platform engineers one tested place to evolve implementation and
gives tenants a smaller, safer desired-state vocabulary. The charts accept tenant configuration,
but platform entrypoints supply the trusted repository, revision, Registry, build policy, and
infrastructure coordinates.

The consequence is intentional platform opinion. A tenant can choose among supported profiles and
configure exposed values, but cannot substitute an arbitrary implementation source through its
System repository.

## Design rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Reconcile from Git without writing back | Tenant Git is the declared state, so charts and controllers only read it and report status through Argo CD, Tekton, and workload conditions. Avoiding controller-generated commits prevents feedback loops and preserves a clear distinction between requested state and observed state. |
| Discover intent with layered ApplicationSets | Domain, System, and leaf layers mirror the catalog concepts and ownership model already presented in Backstage. Small discovery files let Argo CD create only the Applications implied by tenant intent, without a central process regenerating a large manifest. Their paths and presence are consequently treated as a stable, tested interface. |
| Keep trusted implementation coordinates in platform values | Tenants can select supported profiles and configure exposed behavior, but the platform supplies the chart repository and revision. This prevents tenant state from redirecting Argo CD to arbitrary implementation code. Adding a new Resource implementation is therefore an intentional platform change with its own chart, schema, and compatibility tests. |
| Use one Application per Component environment | The environment declaration creates the Container Application and its ImageStream immediately. Its optional release file adds `image.tag`; workload and promotion resources render only after that selection, so registry provisioning still converges before a release without requiring a second Application. |
| Build once and materialize releases from the built digest | The build environment produces `git-<sha>`, and a human Git tag resolves that commit before copying the existing image to a release tag. A small digest guard refuses to reassign an existing human version to a different artifact. This avoids a release-time rebuild and preserves the link to the built commit. The current Maven step still uses `-DskipTests`, so test execution remains a separate policy. |
| Use environment-local repositories and adjacent promotion | Each runtime pulls from its own environment's Quay repository, keeping credentials local and making image transport an explicit event. External Secrets places the immediately preceding repository's narrowly scoped pull credential in the target namespace; the target PipelineRun combines it with the target push credential. Direct skipping and reverse copying are intentionally excluded; rollback selects an older release and follows the same forward path. |
| Assign each shared AppProject one owner | One parent Domain Application owns the Domain project. System projects remain owned by their build-environment controller. |
| Use retained Sync hooks for initial publication and build | The first API publication and Component build must affect Argo CD readiness, so hook Jobs start the PipelineRun, follow its result, and fail the sync when necessary. Successful named Jobs are retained to prevent an ordinary resync from repeating unchanged work; failed hooks are removed so a later sync can retry after correction. |

## Control flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    accTitle: Developer chart control flow
    accDescr: Domain and System tenant repositories feed their matching charts. The System chart creates build-environment API Applications plus Component and Resource Applications that reconcile OpenShift APIs.
    entry[Domain Application] --> domain[Domain chart]
    domainGit[Domain catalog and activation files] --> domain
    domain --> systemApps[System Applications]
    systemApps --> system[System chart]
    systemGit[System desired-state files] --> system
    system --> apiApps["API Applications<br/>build environment only"]
    system --> componentApps[Container Component Applications]
    system --> resourceApps[Resource Applications]
    apiApps --> cluster[OpenShift APIs]
    componentApps --> cluster
    resourceApps --> cluster
```

The Domain chart is evaluated once per Domain and emits one System-discovery ApplicationSet per
ordered environment. Every System environment discovers Component environments and Resources.
Each Component Application optionally consumes its matching release file. API publication is
discovered only by the build-environment System Application.

## Discovery signals

| Level | Discovery pattern | Scope | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domain | `systems/*/environments/<environment>.yaml` | Selected environment | One active System Application |
| System | `apis/*/values.yaml` | Build environment only | One OpenAPI publication Application |
| System | `components/*/environments/<environment>.yaml` | Selected environment | One Container Component Application |
| Values | Optional `components/*/releases/<environment>.yaml` | Selected environment | Image selection merged into that Component Application |
| System | `resources/*/*/environments/<environment>.yaml` | Selected environment | One Resource implementation Application |

The environment file is the discovery signal. The Container chart creates its ImageStream without a
release; selecting a release adds workload and, outside the build environment, promotion resources
without changing the Application boundary.

## Values flow and ownership

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    accTitle: Values flow and ownership
    accDescr: The Domain Application supplies platform values and the Domain catalog supplies tenant policy. The Domain and System charts pass trusted configuration to leaf charts.
    entry["Domain Application<br/>trusted platform target values"] --> domain
    catalog["Domain catalog-info.yaml<br/>lifecycle and tenant SCM identity"] --> domain[Domain chart]
    domain -->|"normalized chart URL, lifecycle, group ID,<br/>Registry and build policy"| system[System chart]
    systemState[System Git values] --> system
    system -->|"trusted chart source plus merged intent"| leaves[API, Component, and Resource charts]
```

| Value class | Owner | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tenant identity | Domain catalog entity | SCM host, tenant organization, Domain repository |
| Lifecycle | Domain catalog entity | Environment order, build environment, namespace suffixes |
| Platform integration | Platform target values | Argo CD namespace, router domain, chart repository, Quay, Schema Registry, build policy |
| System intent | System repository | APIs, Component configuration and releases, Resources |
| Implementation | Developer charts | Templates, Tasks, RBAC, workloads, Resource profiles |

The Domain chart normalizes the platform chart clone URL once and passes it through
`delivery.charts`. Child charts never reconstruct that URL from tenant identity. Resource
declarations can select a supported implementation path but cannot replace the platform repository
or revision.

Tenant catalog ownership is normalized to `group:default/domain-maintainers`. The Domain chart
passes that fixed owner into every System environment rather than deriving a per-Domain group.

The Domain chart synthesizes `environment.clusterDomain` for the existing System contract from the
target-owned router domain. `build.sccClusterRoleName` is carried through but not consumed by a leaf
template. Routes use OpenShift-assigned hosts, and SCC
authorization remains an external platform responsibility.

## Environment lifecycle

Environment names are not built into the charts. The Domain supplies an ordered lifecycle:

```yaml
spec:
  environments:
    order: [dev, test, prod]
    build: dev
    definitions:
      dev:
        namespaceSuffix: -dev
      test:
        namespaceSuffix: -test
      prod:
        namespaceSuffix: ""
```

The build environment must be first. Source builds happen only there; image promotion moves to the
immediately following environment.

`spec.platformTarget` reserves a target-selection seam, but environment-level multi-cluster
placement is not implemented in this release. Every Domain environment uses the selected target.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    accTitle: Adjacent image promotion
    accDescr: Dev builds source and promotes immutable digests to test. Test promotes the same releases onward to prod.
    build["dev<br/>builds source"] -->|copy immutable digest| test[test]
    test -->|copy immutable digest| prod["prod<br/>no namespace suffix"]
```

The charts render no direct dev-to-prod path and no reverse copy for rollback. Rollback selects an
older release tag and promotes it through the same adjacent path.

## Argo CD project ownership

| AppProject | Contains | Created by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tenant-<domain>-admission` | One parent Domain Application | Platform admission directory |
| `tenant-<domain>` | System controller Applications | Parent Domain Application |
| `tenant-<domain>-<system>` | API, Component, and Resource leaf Applications | System build-environment Application |

The parent Domain Application creates its derived AppProject at sync wave 0. Discovery
ApplicationSets render at wave 1. System projects retain their existing build-environment ownership.
The current projects are organizational and permissive; authorization hardening is separate.

## API publication

The API chart installs one Pipeline with a shared validation and publication path:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    accTitle: API specification publication
    accDescr: An API Git revision is cloned, validated, and published under its commit SHA. Human release tags also publish an immutable named version.
    source[API Git revision] --> clone[git-clone]
    clone --> rules[Clone pinned Spectral rules]
    rules --> spectral[Spectral quality gate]
    spectral --> sha["Apicurio version<br/>exact commit SHA"]
    release{Human release tag?}
    sha --> release
    release -->|yes| human["Apicurio version<br/>v&lt;major&gt;[.&lt;minor&gt;[.&lt;patch&gt;]][-prerelease]"]
    release -->|no| done[Complete]
```

An Argo CD Sync hook invokes the Pipeline for the initial revision. EventListener webhooks handle
later main pushes and release tags. The Pipeline uses the curated `tekton-tasks/maven` Task with
Java 21 and the API repository's official Apicurio Maven plugin configuration. Spectral is the
only validation gate; the Pipeline contains no inline `yq` fallback or custom Registry client.

Main publication is idempotent through `FIND_OR_CREATE_VERSION`. A human tag publishes or resolves
the SHA first, then creates the human Registry version with `CREATE_VERSION`.

## Component build and release

Build resources render only when Component values set `build.enabled: true` and the selected
environment matches `build.environment`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    accTitle: Component build and release paths
    accDescr: Main pushes package source without running tests, build commit-tagged images, and update latest. Human Git tags resolve an existing commit image and copy it to a human release tag.
    main[Main push] --> clone[git-clone]
    clone --> package["Maven package<br/>tests skipped"]
    package --> buildah[Buildah push]
    buildah --> commitImage["git-&lt;full-commit-sha&gt;"]
    commitImage --> latest[Update build-environment latest]
    tag[Human Git tag] --> resolve[Resolve peeled commit SHA]
    resolve --> locate[Locate existing commit image]
    commitImage --> locate
    locate --> guard[Assert human tag is absent or matches]
    guard --> alias[Curated skopeo-copy Task]
```

The release branch never packages source, rebuilds an image, updates `latest`, or restarts the
runtime. The shared `assert-image-tag-compatible` Task inspects source and destination digests. An
absent destination or an existing matching digest is safe; an existing different digest fails
before the copy. The copy itself is performed by the cluster-resolved
`openshift-pipelines/skopeo-copy` Task. CF-IDP does not automate Quay immutable-tag policy.

The initial build is an Argo CD Sync hook Job. It follows the PipelineRun with `tkn` and fails the
sync if the build fails. A successful Job is retained so ordinary syncs do not rebuild unchanged
source.

## Image promotion

Every active environment owns a distinct Quay repository. A non-build release renders a runtime and
a deterministic launcher Job in the target namespace.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    accTitle: Image promotion flow
    accDescr: Merging a release selection causes Argo CD to create a launcher Job. The Job starts a Tekton Pipeline that copies and verifies the image digest between Quay repositories.
    git[Merge versioned release selection in System Git]
    git --> argocd[Argo CD reconciles the target runtime and launcher Job]
    argocd --> launcher[Launcher starts the target promote-image PipelineRun and exits]
    launcher --> source[Pipeline resolves the digest from the source Quay repository]
    source --> guard[Reject a conflicting destination version]
    guard --> copy[Curated skopeo-copy Task copies by digest]
    copy --> result[Return source and destination digests]
```

Each activated target environment uses External Secrets to materialize the immediately preceding
environment's named, narrowly scoped Quay pull credential in its own namespace. The target owns the
reader, SecretStore, ExternalSecret, and minimal named-Secret RBAC bridge back to the source; the
first environment creates no incoming credential resources. The target `pipeline` ServiceAccount
references the local source credential and target-local push credential, with no permission to read
source Secrets directly. The generated source credential scopes its Docker auth entry to the source
Quay organization path, so it can coexist with the target push robot on the same registry host.
Tekton merges both credentials into its standard registry configuration.

CF-IDP implements only the pre-copy release invariant. Normal publish, human release
materialization, and environment promotion all resolve the curated
`openshift-pipelines/skopeo-copy` Task for the copy primitive. Skopeo remains in the compact guard
only to inspect digests.

The Deployment and PipelineRun converge independently. Temporary `ImagePullBackOff` is expected
until the target-local image exists.

## Resource implementations

Tenant state selects a supported profile and implementation path:

```yaml
profile: postgresql
implementation:
  path: charts/resource/postgresql
```

The System chart injects the trusted platform repository and revision. The current PostgreSQL
profile layers common and environment values into one Crunchy `PostgresCluster`.
